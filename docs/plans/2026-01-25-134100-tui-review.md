Do a thorough analysis of the TUI and identify areas for improvement.

Keep going until you have explored all aspects of the 'orbital' CLI tool.

Keep track of all functionality in your notes.

When you have a full understanding of the tool, design an integrated, complete, nicely working TUI interface.

Use the appropriate skills.

The final output should be a PRD document that outlines the design and implementation of the TUI interface.
